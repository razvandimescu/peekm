## Why peekm Over Alternatives?

**VS Code Preview?** Splits your editor, breaks your flow, tied to VS Code
**GitHub/GitLab?** Requires pushing changes, narrow layout, needs internet
**grip?** No directory browsing, no themes, requires Python runtime
**Browser + file://?** No hot reload, no syntax highlighting, ugly rendering

**peekm gives you:**
- ✨ **Instant preview** with one command
- 🎯 **Centered, distraction-free layout** (not cramped like GitHub)
- 📁 **Navigate entire documentation trees** without opening new tabs
- 🌗 **Dark/light themes** that follow your system
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — just download and run

## Features That Matter

### 🎯 **Focus Mode**
- **Centered 900px layout** — optimized for reading, not scanning
- **Clean GitHub styling** — familiar and beautiful
- **Distraction-free** — no ads, popups, or navigation clutter

### ⚡ **Zero Friction**
- **Single binary** — download and run, nothing to install
- **No configuration** — works perfectly out of the box
- **Instant startup** — under 100ms to first render

### 🔄 **Live Workflow**

  - 🌲 Collapsible directories (auto-collapsed at depth 2+)
  - 📄 Pagination with "Load More" button (shows 5 items initially)
  - 🧭 Console-like navigation (λ button) - navigate between directories
- **Theme switching** — comfortable reading any time of day (Light/Dark/Auto)

### 🔒 **Production-Ready**

## Usage

### Single File Mode

View a specific markdown file with live reload:

```bash
# View a markdown file
peekm README.md

# Custom port
peekm -port 8080 document.md

# Don't auto-open browser
peekm -browser=false notes.md
```

### Directory Browser Mode

Browse all markdown files in a directory with a visual tree:

```bash
# Browse current directory
peekm

# Browse a specific directory
peekm ../docs

# Browse with custom port
peekm -port 8080 ~/Documents/notes
```

The browser mode shows:
- 📂 Interactive directory tree with all `.md` files
- 🌲 Collapsible folders - click ▶/▼ to expand/collapse directories
- 📄 Pagination - loads 5 items at a time with "Load More" button
- 🔗 Clickable file links for easy navigation
- 📊 File sizes displayed for each markdown file
- 🔍 Smart scanning (skips hidden dirs, node_modules, vendor, dist)
- 🎨 Theme toggle (light/dark/auto) in top-right corner
- 🧭 Directory navigation (λ button) in top-left corner - navigate to any directory within $HOME

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-port` | `6419` | Port to serve on |
| `-browser` | `true` | Automatically open browser |
| `-version` | `false` | Show version information |

## When You Need peekm

### Scenario 1: AI-Assisted Development (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
```bash
# Start peekm in your project directory
peekm .

# Ask your AI agent: "Create a detailed API documentation in docs/api.md"
# → peekm instantly shows a toast notification
# → Click the notification to view the newly created file
# → See live updates as the AI continues writing
```
**Stop hunting for AI-generated files.** When Claude Code or other AI assistants create markdown files, peekm immediately notifies you with a clickable toast notification in the top-right corner. Click it to instantly view the new file. Watch live as the AI writes — no manual refresh, no searching through your file tree, no breaking your flow.

### Scenario 2: Onboarding to a New Project
```bash
git clone github.com/awesome/project
cd project
peekm docs/    # Instantly browse all documentation with a visual tree
```
**Navigate complex documentation structures without getting lost.** Collapsible folders keep you oriented. See file sizes to prioritize what to read. Jump between files without opening new tabs.

### Scenario 3: Writing Documentation
```bash
peekm README.md    # Edit in your favorite editor
```
**See your changes instantly.** No manual refresh. No build step. Write in your editor, preview in your browser. The way it should be.

### Scenario 4: Code Review
```bash
# Reviewing a PR with documentation changes
git checkout feature-branch
peekm CHANGELOG.md
```
**Beautiful rendering makes reviewing documentation changes a pleasure.** Compare branches by switching between them — peekm auto-reloads. Spot formatting issues before they hit main.

### Scenario 5: Learning a New Library
```bash
peekm ~/dev/library-examples/
```
**Browse through example markdown files quickly.** The tree view shows you what's available at a glance. Collapsible directories let you focus on one section at a time. Dark mode for late-night learning sessions.

## How It Works

1. **Parse** - Converts markdown to HTML using [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark)
2. **Serve** - Starts a local HTTP server with graceful shutdown
3. **Watch** - Monitors file changes using [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) with proper resource management
4. **Reload** - Sends live updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. **Render** - Applies GitHub styling with embedded CSS (zero runtime dependencies)

## Architecture

peekm follows Go best practices with production-ready, hardened architecture:

- **Resource Management** - Proper file watcher lifecycle with context-based cancellation
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Clean resource cleanup on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Panic Recovery** - Middleware prevents crashes, logs stack traces
- **Security** - Layered defense: symlink validation, path traversal protection, whitelist, $HOME boundary enforcement
- **Performance** - Embedded resources loaded once at startup for fast serving
- **Concurrency** - Thread-safe state management with RWMutex protection
- **Code Quality** - Named types with composition, DRY helpers, centralized route registration
- **HTTP Timeouts** - Read (15s), Write (15s), and Idle (60s) timeouts configured

## Screenshots

When you run `peekm README.md`, your markdown is displayed in a clean, centered layout with:

- GitHub-style formatting
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Automatic table of contents via heading IDs
